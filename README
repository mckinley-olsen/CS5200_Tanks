This project is the implementation of requirements described in assignments for the fall 2012 CS5200(distributed network programming) course at USU.
Throughout the course, the goal has been to incrementally implement systems that allow for a virtual water fight. As per requirements of the course, I have personalized and modified this description to be a virtual shell fight, where players request shells, fill shells, and fire shells at other players.
To allow for this fight, there are 3 distinct entities that manage resources in the game. These include:
	- a fight manager, which manages player interaction, stats, etc.
	- a shell manager, which manages the shell resource
	- a gunpowder manager, which manages the gunpowder resource
	
The netbeans projects contained in the Implementation folder are the implementation of these distinct entities.
The message classes project contains the implementation of the messages required for these entities to communicate.
The common project contains implementation that is common and used between all entities in the system.

A more thorough description of the system can be found in the Documentation folder.
Note that there are two classes, ByteList and MessageNumber, that are simply conversions and were not written by me.
